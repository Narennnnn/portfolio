                        Built the <b>Developer Portal</b> (Next.js 16) — a Stripe/TrueLayer-style self-service platform
                        for B2B partners to integrate with Reewild's rewards API. Features dual-environment architecture
                        (Sandbox for testing, Production on approval), OAuth 2.0 authentication, real-time webhook logs
                        with analytics, and secure credential rotation — reducing partner integration time
                        significantly. Created the <b>API Documentation Site</b> using Fumadocs with OpenAPI 3.0
                        auto-generation, interactive endpoint explorer, and Mermaid.js diagrams for webhook flows —
                        enabling developers to fully understand the requirement for implementing or interacting with
                        Reewild's exposed APIs(Next. js). Led <b>Email Receipt Radar</b> with Nylas integration —
                        secured Google's review approval; currently in end-to-end testing to auto-scan email receipts
                        and reward PlanetPoints. Integrated <b>Apple & Google Wallet Passes</b> for the Planet Points
                        Program — users add passes directly from the app and receive real-time push updates on points &
                        transactions (Node.js). Built a <b>.NET service</b> for automated email notifications via
                        SendGrid with cron-scheduled messaging. Migrated onboarding from web OAuth to <b>in-app
                            passwordless OTP login</b> — owned end-to-end implementation in the mobile app. Introduced
                        <b>personalized Stories</b> showcasing user wins, progress, and environmental impact with
                        Instagram sharing support. Contributing to mobile app features and performance
                        optimizations(React Native).

            <h2>my story</h2>
            <p>I'm from Ayodhya — fluent in Awadhi, Hindi, and professional English. Growing up, I watched my cousins do incredible things on our home PC, and that's when something clicked. The idea that a machine could be so powerful, so versatile — it sparked a curiosity that never really went away. The more I learned and built, the more fascinating this field became. Even now, every day teaches me something new.</p>

            <p>I've always been the studious-but-outgoing type. School topper in 12th, but also the guy leading NCC cadets as Senior Under Officer, organizing social activities, and making sure things never got boring. That balance of discipline and fun has stayed with me.</p>

            <p>What excites me about engineering? A new problem to solve every day. The chance to fix yesterday's mistakes and build something better today. I thrive in environments with challenging problems and real opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

            <p>My first role was at Tonnochy Capital, a Hong Kong-based high-frequency trading startup — REST APIs, WebSockets, real-time data at scale. Milliseconds mattered. I learned to build clean, efficient, fault-tolerant systems. Now at Reewild, I've taken ownership of projects like the Developer Portal, API Documentation, and Email Receipt Radar (secured Google's approval). Every project is an opportunity to combine technical precision with user experience.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, <a href="https://strava.app.link/ljQafIo2IYb" target="_blank">running</a> has become a big part of my life. Recently hit 17.17 km at a 5:30/km pace — training for a half marathon now. There's something about endurance sports that mirrors engineering: show up consistently, embrace the discomfort, trust the process. I'm also adventurous — recently explored Konkan, soaking in local Marathi culture, cuisine, and learning how people live differently.</p>

            <p>When I'm not running or coding, you'll find me with coffee, good music, or a great movie. I play cricket, 8-ball pool, and snooker to unwind. I believe the best teams thrive on trust, open communication, and a sense of fun — and I bring that energy to every collaboration.</p>
