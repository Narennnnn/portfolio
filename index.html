            <h2>my story</h2>
            <p>I started my journey in computer science at Graphic Era University, where I quickly developed a passion for backend development and distributed systems. During my academic years, I focused on building a strong foundation in both theory and practical applications.</p>
            <p>My first professional experience came at Tonnochy Capital, where I worked on developing robust backend systems for cryptocurrency market data. This opportunity allowed me to work with Spring Boot, WebSockets, and concurrent programming in a high-stakes environment where performance and reliability were critical.</p>
            <p>Currently at Reewild, I'm expanding my skills across the full stack, working on projects that combine frontend technologies like Next.js with secure backend systems. These applications focus on sustainability and carbon footprint reduction, enabling users to make more environmentally conscious choices.</p>
            <p>Through my projects and work experience, I've developed expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Python, and modern JavaScript frameworks. I'm particularly interested in building scalable, efficient systems that can handle complex data operations and real-time communication.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I'm an active participant in programming contests, hackathons, and community events. I'm passionate about cricket and enjoy playing 8-ball pool and snooker to unwind. I'm also an avid movie watcher, always up for discussing the latest films and classics alike.</p>
            <p>I bring a collaborative and fun energy to every team I work with, believing that the best solutions come from open communication and mutual respect. I'm always looking to learn and experiment with new technologies while making meaningful connections with colleagues.</p>
