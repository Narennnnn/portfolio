        <h2>my story</h2>
        <p>I began my computer science journey at Graphic Era University, where curiosity quickly turned into a passion for backend development and distributed systems. I loved the challenge of taking ideas and turning them into reliable, high-performance software that could solve real problems.</p>
        
        <p>My first professional role was at Tonnochy Capital, a Hong Kong-based high-frequency trading startup. There, I built high-performance integrations for cryptocurrency market connectivity — working with REST APIs, WebSockets, and concurrency patterns to handle real-time data at scale. It was a fast-paced environment where milliseconds mattered, and I learned the value of clean, efficient, and fault-tolerant systems.</p>
        
        <p>Now at Reewild, I’ve been fortunate to work across the stack, taking complete ownership of projects like integrating Nylas for our upcoming Email Receipt Radar, enabling users to connect and process receipts seamlessly. I’ve integrated Apple & Google Wallet Passes for the Planet Points program, built a .NET service for automated email notifications, migrated onboarding flows to passwordless login, and introduced personalized features like Instagram-style Stories. Every project has been an opportunity to combine technical precision with a focus on user experience.</p>
        
        <p>Through these experiences, I’ve strengthened my skills in Java, Spring Boot, Python, Node.js, .NET, and modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js. I’m drawn to building scalable, modular, and secure systems that handle complex data operations and real-time communication with ease.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of work, I’m an active participant in hackathons, coding contests, and developer communities. I recharge by playing cricket, 8-ball pool, and snooker, and I’m always up for a great movie — whether it’s a new release or a timeless classic. I believe the best teams thrive on trust, open communication, and a sense of fun, and I aim to bring that energy to every collaboration.</p>
